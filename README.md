## Project Overview

This project aims to create a lightweight and efficient idle game where {nodes} reprsenting indivuals interact, move, and learn about each other using an LLM to power their brain. The game is implemented in C for core logic and performance, with Python handling LLM integration.

## Tech Considerations
C -> Core Logic
- High efficiency + low overhead

Python -> LLM Integration
- Rich ecosystem for ML, ease of use, flexible

Cython -> Communication Layer

The project needs to be small. As an idle game, the user shouldn't expect it to take up any resources -- there might be some leeway, since more technically adept users would spot it using an LLM but that's an assumption.
