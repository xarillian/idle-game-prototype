# Idle Game Prototype

This project aims to create a lightweight and efficient idle game where {nodes} reprsenting individual characters interact, move, and learn about each other using an LLM to power their brain. The game is implemented in C for core logic and performance, with Python handling LLM integration.

This version served as a crude prototype to prove my idea worked and as a company showcase for Andgo Systems. The project has since evolved; the current project utilizing Godot rather than C for visuals.
